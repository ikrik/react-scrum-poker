# React Scrum Poker

### Introduction

The goal is to implement a web application that will be used by a remote scrum team, during their sprint planning session, to privately vote on the complexity score of a single story (task/feature to be implemented).

The team does their planning over a conference call so they have direct communication. When discussing some specific story, they want to jump to this "scrum voting application", set the voting subject, vote privately, and finally reveal the votes for the team to assess. This process is repeated multiple times during the sprint planning meeting for different stories.

### Implementation

The Application is implemented by using **Create-React-App, Typescript, React Hooks & Redux**.

The data is being fetch by **Firebase** and the app uses **Real-time Database**.

### Getting Started

Once you have cloned the repo to your local file system use yarn package manager to install all dependecies.

```bash
 yarn install

Î‘lternatively you can use npm.

```bash
 npm install
```

### Build
